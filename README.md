### System Control Pannel

Credit:

in order to create my buttons for this project i have used simple if statements to change the value of my buttons from on to off. I found the code needed to do this on the stackoverflow through google. The code belongs to user <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6089593/creating-an-on-off-button-with-javascript" target="_blank">fl00r</a> as he was the most recent person to edit the answer provided in the page linked above.
